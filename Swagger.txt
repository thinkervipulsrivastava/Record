Spring Boot RestFul API Documentation with Swagger 2

Spring Boot Restful API help us to provide the documentation of Restful to the consumer

Documentation : This documentation help consumer 
which service is available
the signature
the expected input
To check serice is up
Documentation need to be updated with exposed service changes automatically

If documentation updation happen manually it will be tedious process as the number of Rest Services increase that's why Swagger came into picture

What is Swagger ?

Swagger is widely used for visualization APIs
and Swagger UI it provides online sandbox for frontend developers

Swagger is a tool, a specifiaction and complete framework implementation
for producing the visual representation of RESTful Web Services

We need the Swagger dependency

springfox-swagger-ui

springfox-swagger2

To enable the Swagger2 We use the annotation
@EnableSwagger2
We will create a Docket bean in a Spring Boot configuration 

@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {
@Bean
public Docket productApi (){
return new Docket (DocumentationType.SWAGGER2)
.select.apis (RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage ("com.infotech.controller"))
.paths (regex ("/hello."))
.build ();
}
}
